# Python_day2
Python - Python is a high level, interpreted and dynamically typed programming language.

High level programming language - Programming languages that can be easily understood by coders because of usage of language in building logics.

 Interpreted - In interpreted programming languages, the code is translated into machine language and executed line by line at its runtime.

Dynamically programming language-
Dynamically programming language, we do not specified any datatypes in compiling time.

statically programming language-
Statically programming language is a predefined function 

Datatypes- 
INTEGER 
STRING
BOOLEAN 
FLOATING 

Type conversation- 
we specified type conversation for knowing the Datatype 
example  :

a=1
print(a)
print (type(a))
b=string(a)
print=(b)
print(type(b))

<'class int'>
<'class string'>


Day_3

* Why Index starts from a zero value?
* Index having a off-site distance from 1st value to itself.
* Index starts from zero value

 example :[t,e,l,u,g,u]- >Index

From 1st element 't' to itself value is zero.
from element 't' to  'e' value is 1
from element 't' to  'l' value is 2
from element 't' to  'u' value is 3
from element 't' to  'g' value is 4
from element 't' to  'u' value is 5


Lists: Group of data should store in lists
and list are called as heterogeneous datatypes.
we can store any datatypes in the lists 
like: number, string,integer etc..
we can add 1 value for variable also and we use ".append " for adding elements in the lists

Real-life example are- we can store multiple items in fridge 


example : 
number = [1, "hello", true ]
print(nums)
nums.count("1")
nums.append("apples")
nums.index(1)
nums.remove("hello")

output> 
>2
> 1 ,hello,true ,apples
>0
>1,true

Arrays :
Arrays are homogeneous datatypes we can store a same datatypes in an Array.
Dynamic Arrays :
we do not specified any datatypes in compiling time.
static Arrays:
is a predefined function 


Day-4

variables:naming convention 
* variables are starts with alphabets and underscore 
* we can't declare with numbers and special characters
* we declare variables with meaningful names
* variables are like memory container

Mutable and Immutable Data structure:

Mutable: we can access multiple things at a time 
Immutable: we can't access multiple things or applications at a time or same time,if we access multiple applications in a same time it will be hanging or deadlock the application. this situation is also called a deadlock condition
That's why we use a Immutable data structure in these situations.
