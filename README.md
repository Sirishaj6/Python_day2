Python - Python is a high level, interpreted and dynamically typed programming language.

High level programming language - Programming languages that can be easily understood by coders because of usage of language in building logics.

 Interpreted - In interpreted programming languages, the code is translated into machine language and executed line by line at its runtime.

Dynamically programming language-
Dynamically programming language, we do not specified any datatypes in compiling time.

statically programming language-
Statically programming language is a predefined function 

Datatypes- 
INTEGER 
STRING
BOOLEAN 
FLOATING 

Type conversation- 
we specified type conversation for knowing the Datatype 
example  :

a=1
print(a)
print (type(a))
b=string(a)
print=(b)
print(type(b))

<'class int'>
<'class string'>
